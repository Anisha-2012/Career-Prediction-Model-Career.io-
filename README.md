# Career Prediction Model

This project offers a predictive model to assist users in determining their career paths within the computer science domain based on their interests in various fields. The fields considered in our data include:

- Database Fundamentals
- Computer Architecture
- Distributed Computing Systems
- Cyber Security
- Networking
- Software Development
- Programming Skills
- Project Management
- Computer Forensics Fundamentals
- Technical Communication
- AI ML
- Software Engineering
- Business Analysis
- Communication skills
- Data Science
- Troubleshooting skills
- Graphics Designing

Each user provides scores ranging from 0 to 10 for each field, indicating their interest level. Utilizing this data, our model predicts the most suitable career path for the user based on their interests.

## Implementation

We employ three different algorithms for career prediction:

1. **Logistic Regression:** This algorithm classifies users into different career paths based on their interest scores in various fields.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model:** The KNN model predicts users' potential career paths by comparing their interest scores with those of similar users in the dataset.
3. **Linear Regression Model:** Linear regression establishes a relationship between users' interest scores and their prospective career paths, allowing for accurate predictions.

## Data Preparation

We collected data from 10 different sources and combined them to create a clean and comprehensive dataset. This dataset forms the basis for our predictive model, ensuring accurate career predictions.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to:

- **Website Integration:** Merge the Career Prediction System into our website, allowing users to access it conveniently.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Explore the use of more complex algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines to further improve prediction accuracy.
- **User Feedback Incorporation:** Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to refine the model continuously and enhance its predictive capabilities.

## Maximum Accuracy

After evaluating the performance of each algorithm, we found that the KNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 95%. This exceptional accuracy underscores the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive approach.
