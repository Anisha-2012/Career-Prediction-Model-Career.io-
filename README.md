Career Prediction Model
This project aims to assist users in predicting their career paths within the field of computer science based on their interests. We utilized various fields such as Database Fundamentals, Software Development, AI/ML, and more to create a comprehensive model.

This project offers a predictive model to assist users in determining their career paths within the computer science domain based on their interests in various fields. The fields considered in our data include:

Database Fundamentals

Distributed Computing Systems
Cyber Security
Networking
Software Development
Programming Skills
Project Management
Computer Forensics Fundamentals
Technical Communication
AI ML
Software Engineering
Business Analysis
Communication skills
Data Science
Troubleshooting skills
Graphics Designing

Each user provides scores ranging from 0 to 10 for each field, indicating their interest level. Utilizing this data, our model predicts the most suitable career path for the user based on their interests.

Implementation
We employ three different algorithms for career prediction:

Logistic Regression: This algorithm classifies users into different career paths based on their interest scores in various fields.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model: The KNN model predicts users' potential career paths by comparing their interest scores with those of similar users in the dataset.

Linear Regression Model: Linear regression establishes a relationship between users' interest scores and their prospective career paths, allowing for accurate predictions.

Data Preparation
We collected data from 10 different sources and combined them to create a clean and comprehensive dataset. This dataset forms the basis for our predictive model, ensuring accurate career predictions.

Maximum Accuracy
After evaluating the performance of each algorithm, we found that the KNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 95%. This exceptional accuracy underscores the reliability and effectiveness of our predictive approach.

Usage
To use the Career Prediction System, users provide their interest scores for each field. The system then predicts the most suitable career path based on these scores.

Future Enhancements
In the future, we plan to:

Website Integration: Merge the Career Prediction System into our website, allowing users to access it conveniently.
Advanced Algorithms: Explore the use of more complex algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Support Vector Machines to further improve prediction accuracy.
User Feedback Incorporation: Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to refine the model continuously and enhance its predictive capabilities.
